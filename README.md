## About CatPilot OS

CatPilot OS does not interfere without necessity.  
It prefers observation over control.

If the system works, it is left untouched.  
If something changes, it happens consciously.

This project is not for everyone.  
It is for those who value predictability,  
long service life, and respect for time.

Sometimes the best improvement is a pause.

**A minute of reflection is a step into history.**  
**It doesn’t matter who you are. What matters is what you understood before taking that step.**
