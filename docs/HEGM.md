# H.E.G.M.

H.E.G.M. is the core approach used by CatPilot OS.

- **H — Hybrid**  
  Uses proven Windows mechanisms without fanatic replacement.

- **E — Extreme (only where safe)**  
  Optimizations are applied only when they do not affect stability.

- **G — Gold base**  
  A stable, well-tested Windows baseline is preferred over novelty.

- **M — Maximum from stock Windows**  
  No radical rebuilding. The system is refined, not reinvented.

This approach values predictability, long service life,
and respect for user time.
