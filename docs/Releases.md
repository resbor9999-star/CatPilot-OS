# Releases

CatPilot OS does not follow a fixed release schedule.

Releases exist to **capture a stable state**, not to chase novelty.
Each release reflects a period of observation, testing, and restraint.

Changes are introduced only when they are:
- understood
- tested
- reversible

## RETRO

RETRO releases focus on long-term stability and maximum compatibility.

They are designed for:
- proven and legacy hardware
- predictable system behavior
- extended service life

RETRO prioritizes a Gold base and minimal intervention.
If the system works, it remains untouched.

## HYBRID

HYBRID releases balance stability with modern usability.

They are designed for:
- mixed hardware generations
- Windows 10 and Windows 11 IoT
- careful, selective optimizations

Changes are applied only where safe,
without breaking compatibility or user expectations.

## Release philosophy

- Releases are **rare by design**
- No forced upgrades
- No experimental changes without reason
- Stability is always preferred over features

Sometimes the best improvement is a pause.
